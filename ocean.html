<li>The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. It covers an area of approximately 14,056,000 square kilometers (5,427,000 square miles), making it slightly smaller than Antarctica and significantly smaller than the next smallest ocean, the Indian Ocean.</li>
<li>Its extensive coastline—about 45,390 kilometers (28,200 miles) long—borders the northern edges of Eurasia, North America (including Alaska and Canada), Greenland, Iceland, and several Arctic islands.</li>
<li> Geography: The Arctic Ocean forms a roughly circular basin around the North Pole. Surrounded by land, it is nearly landlocked and connected to other oceans via the shallow Bering Strait (to the Pacific), Fram Strait, and the Canadian Archipelago (to the Atlantic).</li>

<h2>PACIFIC OCEAN </h2>
<div id="pacific">
    <div>
<ul>
    <li>The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest ocean on Earth, covering more than 30% of the planet’s surface—a greater area than all the continents combined.</li>
    <li> It stretches from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean in the south, and lies between Asia and Australia on the west and both North and South America on the east.</li>
    <li> With a surface area of about 165–168 million square kilometers (64 million square miles), it encompasses nearly one-third of Earth’s surface and holds over half of its open water.</li>

<ul>
<li>The Atlantic Ocean is the world’s second largest ocean, covering about one-fifth of Earth’s surface and extending from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean in the south.</li>
<li> It separates the continents of Europe and Africa on the east from North and South America on the west.</li>
<li> The name “Atlantic” comes from Greek mythology, meaning the Sea of Atlas.The name “Atlantic” comes from Greek mythology, meaning the Sea of Atlas.</li>

<h2>SOUTHERN OCEAN</h2>
<div id="southrn">
    <div>
<ul>
    <li>The Southern Ocean, also known as the Antarctic Ocean, is the fourth largest of Earth's five major oceans. It completely encircles the continent of Antarctica, forming a vast, unbroken stretch of water south of 60° S latitude.</li>
    <li> The Southern Ocean is distinct in that, unlike other oceans, its northern boundary does not abut any landmass, but is set by oceanographic and climatic features where cold polar waters meet the relatively warmer waters of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans.</li>
    <li>Area: Approximately 21,960,000 square kilometers (8,479,000 square miles), covering about 1/16th of Earth's total ocean area, making it larger only than the Arctic Ocean.</li>

</div>
<ul>
<li>The Indian Ocean is the third-largest ocean on Earth, covering about 70,560,000 square kilometers (27,243,000 square miles), which accounts for roughly 20% of the world’s ocean area.</li>
<li>It is bounded by Asia to the north, Africa to the west, Australia to the east, and extends southward to meet the Southern Ocean.</li>
<li> Notably, its northern part is landlocked, distinguishing it from the other major oceans which all extend into polar regions.</li>
